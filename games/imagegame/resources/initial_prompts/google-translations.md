### Adjustments made:

The adjustments are necessary for successful parsing and to ensure comparability.

1. The tag `instruction:` must be identical (case-insensitive) at:
   - player_a_prompt_header: 3x in the example (l.22, 25, 28)
   - localization_utils

1. The terminate token `DONE` must be
   - translated into respective language
   - identical at:
     - player_a_prompt_header: 1x at end of the longest paragraph (l.17), 1x in the example (l.28)
     - localization_utils
   - if there are different translations: try out what [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/de/translator) says.

1. The grids must be identical to those in `to_translate/`:
   - 2x player_a_prompt_header
   - 2x player_b_prompt_header

   - player_a_prompt_header (l.30)
   - player_b_prompt_header (l.19)
