"""This script is a helper for qualitative evaluation of games.

It creates a big html file (size depending on the arguments specified).
The file contains a list of paths to all transcript files present in the
specified results directory.

Usage of Output:
    When opening the html file in a browser you will get two buttons 'next'
    and 'previous' to navigate through the episodes one after the other.

    Be aware that your progress is not saved when closing the browser.
    Tipp: Don't create one huge transcript_navigator.html for all episodes,
    but one for each game and language.

Usage:
    Call from main directory:
      $ python3 evaluation/create_transcript_navigator.py

Arguments:
    Games, languages or episodes to be included in the output file can be
    specified in the if __name__ block.

Supported games and result types:
    - The script is not game specific but only tested with the imagegame and
      referencegame.
        - I used it only for the imagegame since it's multi-turn. For
          the qualitative analysis of the referencegame there is also the script
          'create_excel_overview.py' which gives a faster overview.
    - It should work with multilingual and monolingual results folders. But was
      developed primarily for multilingual results.
